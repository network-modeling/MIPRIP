# MIPRIP2: Mixed Integer linear Programming based Interaction Predictor 2.0

MIPRIP 2.0 can be used either to predict regulators of one group of samples (single-mode), to identify significant regulators being different between two groups of samples (e.g. disease vs. control) (dual-mode), or can be applied to more than two groups (multi-mode) to identify the most common and group-specific regulators. It was developed to study the regulation of the telomerase in budding yeast, mouse and human, but MIPRIP can straightforwardly be applied to similar problems integrating gene regulator binding information and expression profiles of samples of e.g. two different phenotypes, disease/healthy controls or treatment/controls. With our newly constructed generic human or mouse regulatory network, MIPRIP 2.0 is also applicable to human and mouse gene expression data. MIPRIP 2.0 can deal with weighted edges between the regulators and the target genes.

Best, you follow the tutorial in the short manual which explains how to use the method along with our case study.
